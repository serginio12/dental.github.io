                    <h1>ORTODONTICS </h1>
                    <p> Orthodontics has advanced over decades, and today treatment is a lot shorter and more comfortable that it was in the past. Six Months Smile has taken the best aspects of braces and modified the treatment and the material to give adults a common- sense, cosmetic solution that fits your lifestyle. </p>
                    <p> A specialised fixed brace system, 6 Months Smile, uses clear brackets and tooth-coloured wires which achieve a discreet bind, minimizing the visibility of braces.</p>

                       <h1>TEETH WHITENING</h1>
                       <p>Over time, teeth normally become stained and discoloured by food, drinks, tobacco and other factors. Many people want to have their teeth lightened to brighten up their smile.</p>
                       <br>
                       <p>Teeth whitening is a simple procedure with lasting results, however some people can be sensitive to the chemicals used in teeth whitening, especially if you have sensitive teeth. </p>
                       <p>We ensure you are dentally fit to proceed with whitening, by giving you a thorough dental examination that confirms that whitening your teeth is the best option for you.</p>
                     
                   </div>

                    <h1>VENEERS</h1>
                    <p>Porcelain Veneers are amongst the most popular cosmetic dentistry treatments because of their versatility and appearance. They are thin, custom-made shells crafted from tooth-coloured materials designed to cover the front side of teeth to improve their overall appearance.
 </p>
                        <p>They are made of either thin plastic resin or porcelain, and can be placed to mask poorly formed or mildly mal-positioned teeth, to close gaps between teeth, to improve aesthetic appearance when there are internal stains, restore a partially broken tooth, etc.

                       <h1>BRIDGES</h1>
                       <p>A Bridge is used as a replacement for one or more of your missing teeth. It is natural-looking and functional. A bridge will give you back your natural bite and prevent unwanted movement of adjacent teeth and over eruption of the opposing teeth. We would recommend them as an alternative to a removable partial denture.

                       </p>
                       <p>Our bridges are made from the highest quality materials. We also offer minimal preparation adhesive bridges for the conservation of the tooth tissue when clinical case concerned allows it. </p>
                       <p>A bridge should last for many, many years. But this is dependent on how you care for them. Consider the daily habits that could be affecting your bridge and you'll be able to extend its wear.</p>
