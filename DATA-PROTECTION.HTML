                   <p>Insurance companies will process your claim and send payment or pay directly into your bank account. </p>
                   <p>The amount of money paid depends on what level of insurance you have. Before you start treatment, it is useful to discuss your cover with your dentist to confirm the amount of remuneration.</p>
                   <p>Routine check-ups and dental hygiene appointments are usually covered in full. </p>
                   <p>For other dental treatments (fillings, crowns, inlays, root canals, etc) a percentage of the total amount is paid (ranging from 50% to 100%) again depending on your cover. </p>
                   <p>Emergency one-off treatment is usually covered 100% (seeing a patient on the day with extreme toothache to get that patient out of pain). </p>
                   <p>If you have any questions, please ask any member of our team and we will gladly explain how you could benefit from it.
